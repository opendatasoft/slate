# Dataset status

## The dataset status object

The dataset status describes the current state of a dataset, stating if it's published or not and the running operation. It is a finite state machine, with the following properties:

* a single state at a time
* the list of possible states, fully known
* the list of all transitions, fully known, each with the actions and conditions that can trigger them

Here is the full state machine description.

## The `idle` dataset status

> Example request

```HTTP
curl https://yourdomain.opendatasoft.com/api/management/v2/datasets/da_XXXXXX/status?expand=records_errors \
    -u username:password
```

> Example object

```json
{
    "published": true,
    "status": "idle",
    "since": "2015-04-15T15:13:04+00:00",
    "records_errors": [
        {
            "record_id" : "442cdf84ec84de2474dfba9422b045c064c36f05",
            "processor_uid": "pr_XXXXXX",
            "field_uid": "column_1",
            "message": "Cannot convert \"a\" to \"int\"",
            "raw_message": "Cannot convert \"{value}\" to \"{type}\"",
            "raw_params": {
                "value": "a",
                "type": "int"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

```HTTP
curl https://yourdomain.opendatasoft.com/api/management/v2/datasets/da_XXXXXX/status \
    -u username:password
```

> Example object

```json
{
    "published": true,
    "name": "idle",
    "since": "2015-04-15T15:13:04+00:00",
    "records_errors": 45
}
```

The *idle* status means that the dataset is not currently involved in an action. It can be published or not but no job is running. A newly created dataset is in that status.

### Attributes

Attribute | Description
--------- | -----------
records_errors <br> *[records errors object](#records_errors)* <br> <em class="expandable">expandable</em> | Errors which occurred during the processing. Can be from a processor, or a type conversion. This attribute is present only if the dataset is published.

### Transitions leading to the status

Transition origin status | Transition condition 
--------- | -----------
`processing` | Processing ended successfully
`deleting` | Deleting ended successfully
`aborting_processing` | Processing aborted

### Transitions leaving the status

Transition destination status | Transition condition
--------- | -----------
`queued` | The order has been received and is waiting to be realised


## The `error`Â dataset status

> Example object

```json
{
    "published": true,
    "name": "error",
    "since": "2015-04-15T15:13:04+00:00",
    "message": "Processor pr_XXXXXX is misconfigured for field address: invalid type",
    "raw_message": "Processor {processor_id} is misconfigured for field {field}: {msg}",
    "raw_params": {
        "processor_id": "pr_XXXXXX",
        "field": "address",
        "msg": "invalid type"
    }
    
}
```

The *error* status means that the action failed. It can be an error from the source or a pipeline misconfiguration.

### Attributes
